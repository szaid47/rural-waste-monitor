## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Build Tool**: Vite

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, the app is frontend-only and runs on static mock data for demo purposes.

---

### Suggested Tables:

- `waste_entries`: logs intake with weight, type, and source
- `classification_batches`: tracks sorting and QC
- `processing_status`: monitors workflow progress
- `reports`: stores generated report data per period

You can connect your backend to replace the mock data with real-time queries and enable persistent storage for facility operations.
